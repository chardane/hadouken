A really really old jQuery events demo. Made to teach my interns about javascript event concepts.

A pen that followed the tutorial on http://www.thinkful.com/learn/intro-to-jquery. I used this to teach my awesome interns about event handling, css and jQuery. I deviated from the tutorial a bit and used css animations instead of JS, and only used event handlers for adding and removing classes.
